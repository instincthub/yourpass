**Overview:**

This website allows people to register into an organisation and give admin of the organisation right to verify number of people who attends the events of such organisation.

**problem:**

Due to the presence of the corona virus many organisations including churches, events and mosque have to monitor the numbers of members that come for their events. 

We see many organisations most especially churches using paper to track the number of people that are attending their event. 

This makes the whole process of verifyingmembers slower and paper can be lost which will lead to loss of information and inefficiency in managing members of the organisation

**Solution:**

We have decided to create an open source software that will help people to manage the members they have in their organisation. The initial design will have a **register** page for the members to signup for the organisation, a **signup/login** page for the admin and a **portal** for the admin to control the activities of the members

**Implementation:**

*Using the example of a church*

- If a church wants to know the number of members,  their names and their phone numbers, all they to do is tell thier members to register on yourpass.org
- If a church wants to verify people attending a service, an admin will to scan a members verification barcode or check their phonenumber or check their full name and tick present
- To know how many people attended a service an admin can check the total number of people present for that service on the portal
- To know a member who is no longer interested in an church you can check a members log of event in the organisation or check who hasn’t attended the organisation’s last 3 activities

**Impact:**

- This project will provide a central database where all the activities of an organisation are being monitored
- This project will help an organisation know when a member isn’t attending its events
- This project will help an organisation know how many members are attending its events and effectively comminute to its members when doesn’t want everyone to be present maybe due to COVID
- This project being open source will help people add as many functionalities as they want it. Thereby making it suitable for their own needs
